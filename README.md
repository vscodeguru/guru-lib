# Guru Plugin
It's a **Angular Admin Panel UI Kit** consisting of multiple base components and utilities to enhance [ng-zoro-antd](https://ng.ant.design/docs/introduce/en "ng-zoro-antd")



## Why Guru Plugin

If you have decided to use an **admin template** for creating the back-end of your website and don't want to spend money then **Guru Plugin** is good choice to build admin panel on your own with minimal angular knowledge.

**Ready made admin template** is **bundled with large size of assets** and different **ready to use app's** which are all **not used in real time** but it occupy a major size in application production bundle.

This Kind of ready made **admin template not compatible with angular UI Kits** Like [ng-zoro-antd](https://ng.ant.design/docs/introduce/en "ng-zoro-antd"). So we have to **customize both admin template and UI Kits** even you are using admin template. So Guru Plugin comes with minimal bundle using [ng-zoro-antd](https://ng.ant.design/docs/introduce/en "ng-zoro-antd") UI Kits to overcome this issues by doing some minimal customization.
